## Inspiration
We wanted to encourage people to engage more with the world around them and explore new places.

## What it does
It provides a platform for people to discover new places around them and share their adventures with other users. It includes a map that contains markers at specific places of interest around the area where the user lives, and user can earn points by visiting these places. They can then redeem their points for rewards. There is also a leaderboard that allows users to see how they stack up against their friends in terms of points earned.

## How we built it
We made use of the Google Maps API, HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the app, and used Figma for wireframing.

## Challenges we ran into
Our ideas turned out to be too much to be able to complete in 24 hours, and we ended up not having enough time to implement everything we want to include. Some of us were new to the languages that were used, so we had some initial difficulties with coding the application.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to come up with an idea that everyone agreed on and successfully collaborate with each other. We're glad we were able to make progress on a project idea that we considered to be challenging to implement. For some members, it was either their first time using APIs or their first time using some of the programming languages that were used, but we were able to creating a working application.

## What we learned
We learned which elements were actually crucial for prototypes, we learned new programming languages and practiced using new technologies, and we also learned project management, time management, and teamwork skills.

## What's next for Odyssey
Worldwide expansion! The app currently only supports the DFW area but we hope to change that. We also hope for the application to get sponsors so we can offer more rewards.
